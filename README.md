# php-vanilla-queue-runner
A Queue Runner in vanilla PHP with as few dependencies as possible

Please have in mind - the state of this project is just a proof of concept. There will be a time to download the source 
code and productively use it within your project. But now, it only shows how to create a queue worker just with PHP.
